Orama Cloud offers a rich variety of Native integrations and plugins that helps you integrate with your app with ease. When available, we suggest using native integrations over custom integrations, as they are highly optimized and provide a better developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

If your platform is not listed, you can always build a [custom integration](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations) using [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis).

At the time of writing this, we have the following plugins:
