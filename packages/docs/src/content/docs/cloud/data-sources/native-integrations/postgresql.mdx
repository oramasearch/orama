### Basic Configuration

#### Create a dedicated read-only Postgres user

These steps create a dedicated read-only user for replicating data. Alternatively, you can use an existing Postgres user in your database.

The following commands will create a new user:
```sql
CREATE USER <user_name> PASSWORD 'your_password_here';
```
Now, provide this user with read-only access to relevant schemas and tables. Re-run this command for each schema you expect to replicate data from:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <user_name>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO <user_name>;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO <user_name>;
```

### Advanced Configuration using CDC

Orama Cloud uses [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/logical-replication.html) of the Postgres write-ahead log (WAL) to incrementally capture deletes using a replication plugin:

We recommend configuring your Postgres source with CDC when:

- You need a record of deletions.
- You have a very large database (500 GB or more).
- Your table has a primary key but doesn't have a reasonable cursor field for incremental syncing (`updated_at`).

These are the additional steps required to configure your Postgres source using CDC:

1. Provide additional `REPLICATION` permissions to read-only user
2. Enable logical replication on your Postgres database
3. Create a replication slot on your Postgres database
4. Create publication and replication identities for each Postgres table
5. Add slot and publication to the Orama Cloud data source configuration

#### Step 1: Prepopulate your Postgres source configuration

For CDC, you must connect to primary/master databases. Pointing the data source configuration to replica database hosts for CDC will lead to failures.

#### Step 2: Provide additional permissions to read-only user

To configure CDC for the Postgres data source, grant `REPLICATION` permissions to the user created in the [basic configuration step](#create-a-dedicated-read-only-postgres-user):

```
ALTER USER <user_name> REPLICATION;
```

#### Step 3: Enable logical replication on your Postgres database

To enable logical replication, follow these steps based on your deployment environment.

##### Bare Metal, VMs, and Docker

To enable logical replication on bare metal, VMs (EC2/GCE/etc), or Docker, configure the following parameters in the [postgresql.conf file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html) for your Postgres database.

| Parameter             | Description                                                                    | Set value to                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| wal_level             | Type of coding used within the Postgres write-ahead log                        | `logical`                                                                                                                                |
| max_wal_senders       | The maximum number of processes used for handling WAL changes                  | `min: 1`                                                                                                                                 |
| max_replication_slots | The maximum number of replication slots that are allowed to stream WAL changes | `1` (if Orama Cloud is the only service reading subscribing to WAL changes. More than 1 if other services are also reading from the WAL) |

##### AWS Postgres RDS or Aurora

1. Go to the Configuration tab for your DB cluster.
2. Find your cluster parameter group. Either edit the parameters for this group or create a copy of this parameter group to edit. If you create a  copy, change your cluster's parameter group before restarting.
3. Within the parameter group page, search for `rds.logical_replication`. Select this row and click Edit parameters. Set this value to `1`.
4. Wait for a maintenance window to automatically restart the instance or restart it manually.

:::note 
AWS Aurora implements a [CDC caching layer](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/achieve-up-to-17x-lower-replication-lag-with-the-new-write-through-cache-for-aurora-postgresql/) that is incompatible with Orama Cloud's CDC implementation. To use Orama with AWS Aurora, disable the CDC caching layer. Disable CDC caching by setting the [`rds.logical_wal_cache`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.html) parameter to `0` in the AWS Aurora parameter group.

##### Azure Database for Postgres

Change the replication mode of your Postgres DB on Azure to `logical` using the replication menu of your PostgreSQL instance in the Azure Portal. Alternatively, use the Azure CLI to run the following command:

```
az postgres server configuration set --resource-group group --server-name server --name azure.replication_support --value logical
az postgres server restart --resource-group group --name server
```
#### Step 4: Create a replication slot on your Postgres database

Orama Cloud requires a replication slot configured only for its use. Only one source should be configured that uses this replication slot.

For this step, Orama Cloud requires use of the pgoutput plugin. To create a replication slot called `orama_slot` using pgoutput, run as the user with the newly granted `REPLICATION` role:

```
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('orama_slot', 'pgoutput');
```

The output of this command will include the name of the replication slot to fill into the Orama Cloud data source setup page.

#### Step 5: Create publication and replication identities for each Postgres table

For each table you want to replicate with CDC, follow the steps below:

1. Add the replication identity (the method of distinguishing between rows) for each table you want to replicate:

```
ALTER TABLE tbl1 REPLICA IDENTITY DEFAULT;
```
In rare cases, if your tables use data types that support [TOAST](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html) or have very large field values, consider instead using replica identity type full: `
ALTER TABLE tbl1 REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`.  Ensure that TOAST-able tables use non-TOAST-able primary keys (integers, varchars, etc.), and there will only be a [modest increase in resource utilization, in addition to increased WAL storage size](https://xata.io/blog/replica-identity-full-performance).

2. Create the Postgres publication. You should include all tables you want to replicate as part of the publication:

```
CREATE PUBLICATION orama_publication FOR TABLE <tbl1, tbl2, tbl3>;`
```

The publication name is customizable. Refer to the [Postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-alterpublication.html) if you need to add or remove tables from your publication in the future.

### Connecting with SSL or SSH Tunneling

#### SSL Modes
Here is a breakdown of available SSL connection modes:

- `disable` to disable encrypted communication between Orama Cloud and the source
- `allow` to enable encrypted communication only when required by the source
- `prefer` to allow unencrypted communication only when the source doesn't support encryption
- `require` to always require encryption. Note: The connection will fail if the source doesn't support encryption.
- `verify-ca` to always require encryption and verify that the source has a valid SSL certificate
- `verify-full` to always require encryption and verify the identity of the source

#### SSH Tunneling

For SSH Tunnel Method, select:

- `No Tunnel` for a direct connection to the database
- `SSH Key Authentication` to use an RSA Private as your secret for establishing the SSH tunnel
- `Password Authentication` to use a password as your secret for establishing the SSH tunnel

##### Connect via SSH Tunnel

You can connect to a Postgres instance via an SSH tunnel.

When using an SSH tunnel, you are configuring Orama Cloud to connect to an intermediate server (also called a bastion or a jump server) that has direct access to the database. Orama Cloud connects to the bastion and then asks the bastion to connect directly to the server.

To connect to a Postgres instance via an SSH tunnel:

1. While setting up the Postgres data source, from the SSH tunnel dropdown, select:
   - SSH Key Authentication to use a private as your secret for establishing the SSH tunnel
   - Password Authentication to use a password as your secret for establishing the SSH Tunnel
2. For **SSH Tunnel Jump Server Host**, enter the hostname or IP address for the intermediate (bastion) server that Orama Cloud will connect to.
3. For **SSH Connection Port**, enter the port on the bastion server. The default port for SSH connections is 22.
4. For **SSH Login Username**, enter the username to use when connecting to the bastion server. **Note:** This is the operating system username and not the Postgres username.
5. For authentication:
   - If you selected **SSH Key Authentication**, set the **SSH Private Key** to the [private Key](#generating-a-private-key-for-ssh-tunneling) that you are using to create the SSH connection.
   - If you selected **Password Authentication**, enter the password for the operating system user to connect to the bastion server. **Note:** This is the operating system password and not the Postgres password.

##### Generating a private key for SSH Tunneling

The data source supports any SSH compatible key format such as RSA or Ed25519. To generate an RSA key, for example, run:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM -f myuser_rsa
```

The command produces the private key in PEM format and the public key remains in the standard format used by the `authorized_keys` file on your bastion server. Add the public key to your bastion host to the user you want to use with Orama Cloud. The private key is provided via copy-and-paste to the Orama Cloud data source configuration screen to allow it to log into the bastion server.
